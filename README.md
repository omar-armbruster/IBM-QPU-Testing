Final project for CSCI 0333: Quantum Computing at Middlebury College. Investigates the current capabilities of IBM's quantum computers by running simple quantum simulations on the QPUs available on [IBM's Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) with an increasing number of qubits. The code and writeup for the project are located in [QFTInverse.ipynb](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/).
