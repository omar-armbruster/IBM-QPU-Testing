I have figured out my dependency issues and am now able to run my code in Jupyter. This also allows me to
generate more visually appealing circuit diagrams. I was able to run a simulator, which allows me to run my
circuits using a theoretical model of a quantum computer. Using this, I ran a simple circuit shown in the IBM
tutorials and was able to make a working QFT-1QFT|x> circuit, which behaves as we would expect it. I have 
started building the Shor's algorithm circuit. For now this mostly just includes the two QFTs, but I have also
started researching how to make my own Uf function. Once I am able to finish building the circuit and can run it
on my simulator, I will start researching how to run the circuit on IBM's actual quantum computer, which will
hopefully yield some interesting results.
