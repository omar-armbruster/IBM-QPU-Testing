I have been working on installing qiskit and learning the basics so that I can begin to
implement Shor's algorithm. I have installed qiskit and its adjacent packages (although there
are still some dependency issues to resolve) and am following the basic tutorial on the IBM website.
I have also built the QFT-1QFT|x> circuit to see if we can replicate the results. I have not been able
to run the circuits yet without connecting to the IBM quantum computer, but my goal is to figure out how
to do that next. I have attached the visualization of the QFT circuit below.
